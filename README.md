# CSE 360 - HW4: Staff Role Implementation


## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of **HW4 for CSE 360**, built on top of the team’s TP3 codebase. It focuses on implementing and demonstrating functionality for the **Staff role** in the review application system.

The features were designed using a set of staff-related user stories developed from a collaborative team discussion and align with the needs of moderation, trust monitoring, and communication oversight.

## ✅ Implemented Staff Role Features

1. **View All Reviews** – Staff can monitor all submitted reviews.
2. **Approve/Delete Reviews** – Staff can moderate review content.
3. **View Private Messages** – Staff can monitor user messages for inappropriate behavior.
4. **View Trusted Reviewers** – View which users have been marked trusted by students.
5. **View Reviewer Requests** – See pending role requests to assist instructors.

## 🧪 Testing

JUnit tests are provided in `StaffFeatureTests.java` under `tests/`.  
You can run them using your IDE or command line (e.g., `mvn test` or using Eclipse/IntelliJ test runner).  
All tests validate CRUD operations for reviews, messages, and requests.

## 📘 Documentation

JavaDoc was generated using JDK tools and is available in the `JavaDoc/` folder.  
It includes all newly created and updated classes for HW4.
